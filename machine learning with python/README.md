This is a linear regression solution based on the dataset given to me by FCC. I utilized the linear regression model that is available on Tensorflow documentation 
and tweaked it to fit this particular dataset. This was my first project on FCC so it might not necessarily be my best work (also my first time working within the 
Tensorflow library). My solution is viable based on the predictions against the test dataset, however I think for the future I can create a better linear regression
model.
